Have you looked around your dev team lately and noticed something lacking? I bet you have, and that's women.
Recently, the .NET Foundation released their industry survey results and only 1.8% of respondents identified as women. Sadly, itâ€™s an accurate representation of the industry as a whole- my personal experience is that I have only ever worked with one other female developer!
Why are there so few women in the industry?
What can we do to change this?
