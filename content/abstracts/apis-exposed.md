More and more developers are building APIs, whether that be for consumption by client-side applications, exposing endpoints directly to customers so they can use an alternative front-end or wrapping up services in containers.

Now that we have all these exposed endpoints, what are we doing to secure them? Previously, our monolith was self-contained with limited points of access making authentication and authorisation more straightforward - that’s no longer the case.

We’ll cover the potential risks we may face such as cross-site scripting and BruteForce attacks as well as a look at the possible options for securing API endpoints including OAuth, Access Tokens, JSON web tokens, IP whitelisting, rate limiting to name but a few.
