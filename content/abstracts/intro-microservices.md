Microservice Architecture and the reasons why you should move to it, and the reasons you shouldn't, have been well discussed.
If you have already decided to move over to microservices from monolithic development, then you may be finding the whole process a bit daunting.
What aspects should you, a developer be concerned with?
What does all the terminology mean?
How do the services talk to each other?
In this session, I will show you how to get started with microservices architecture, answering these questions and many more.
We'll look at The Tanzu Tacos project, built with ASP.NET 5, and explore how the whole process fits together from a development point of view.
Hopefully, you'll leave the session with the confidence to start your own microservices application development straight away!
