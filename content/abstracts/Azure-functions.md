Working with an existing system and its architecture can be a challenge, especially when it comes to adopting newer technologies. What may originally have been an appropriate architecture, may not now easily accommodate these newer technologies

Do we tackle the problem by refactoring our system, or do we need an overhaul?

More often than not, business critical features don't allow for a rewrite nor a rebuild, so we are faced with shoehorning new features into the existing project using the older framework or architecture.

This is where serverless technologies, such as Azure Functions, can come to the rescue.

By using Azure Functions you can create solutions using modern .NET/C# features without necessarily touching older parts of our existing software.

In this session I will show you how to build a service using Azure Functions.

We will use a variety of function triggers such as HTTP and Queue, combining them together into a self contained service that can co-exist with our existing project.

We'll also cover security, developing functions locally, architecture and much more.
