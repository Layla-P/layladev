## Welcome back üëã

Hello and welcome back, lovelies! 


It's been an incredibly busy October for me as it has been for many. October is often known as "Hustle Season" as all the conferences seem to be scheduled around this time!


October is also the lead up to the latest release of .NET which is just a few short weeks away. Therefore I have been spoilt for choice of content to share with you all - I hope you enjoy my selections.

This month, I have the pleasure to be joined by Brandon Minnick. Brandon going to chat to you about an important aspect of .NET, and that is its wonderful community and how we can better honour it.

Brandon works as a .NET Developer Advocate at AWS where he gets to work closely with the developer community and help fellow mobile app and cloud developers make 5-star apps.

An avid mobile app developer, Brandon loves to code and has contributed to and published countless apps, like [GitTrends](http://gittrends.com/) and [Punday](http://mondaypunday.com/app).

## Brandon's thoughts

We need to rethink our community programs.

Recently, I was kicked out of the [Microsoft MVP Program](https://twitter.com/TheCodeTraveler/status/1707482832220914072) because I work at AWS. 

Despite creating, and continuing to lead, popular open-source .NET projects like the [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui) (+1.5MM NuGet Downloads) and [AsyncAwaitBestPractices](https://github.com/brminnick/AsyncAwaitBestPractices) (+1.7MM NuGet Downloads), despite delivering .NET presentations at 15 conferences around the world in 2023, and despite me hosting the [The .NET on AWS Show](https://www.art19.com/shows/net-on-aws/episodes/b2ad89e7-ecfa-458e-b132-1e7a80611f3d), Microsoft decided that I do not qualify for their MVP Program because I work for one of their competitors.

To be fair, the [AWS Heroes program](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/) has a similar policy as the Microsoft MVP Program: to join the program, you are required to sign an NDA and competitor companies cannot be granted an NDA. But my question is ‚ÄúWhy is this a requirement‚Äù? 

I strongly believe the purpose of these programs should be to say ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù to a member of the community for dedicating their free time to promoting the company‚Äôs products + services, and to shine a spotlight on them and their great work.

The prestige of being accepted into these programs is a big enough reward. Just by adding ‚ÄúMicrosoft MVP‚Äù, ‚ÄúGoogle Developer Expert‚Äù or ‚ÄúAWS Hero‚Äù to your resume, you will get an immediate interview when you apply for a job that uses the tech stack; you will be fast-tracked for promotions, raises, and leadership opportunities internally at your company; and you will be invited to speak at the most prestigious conferences around the world. 

We should not be denying devoted community experts an opportunity at this prestigious title. Personally, I would happily forgo signing an NDA with the Microsoft MVP program and miss out on the MVP Summits if I could retain the prestige of being a Microsoft MVP.

We can do better. I am currently in conversations with leadership at AWS on how we can improve our program to make it more inclusive, and I encourage all programs to do the same.

### Brandon's recommendations

- For my fellow Visual Studio for Mac users ([RIP VS for Mac](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/)), I highly recommend [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). I‚Äôve been using it on macOS since Microsoft announced the end of VS for Mac, and have been pleasantly surprised! 

- For my fellow .NET MAUI Developers, check out these [3 NuGet Packages](https://codetraveler.io/community-toolkit/) made by me and my CommunityToolkit team: CommunityToolkit.Maui, CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup and CommunityToolkit.Mvvm are must-haves for every .NET MAUI app
