In case you hadn't guessed it - I'm Layla and I'm a self-taught .NET developer! Well that's not strictly true - so many people have helped me get to where I am today. This is one of the reasons I really love what I do. I love to give back to the community, and I do that in many different ways.

* I stream on Twitch
* I blog about tech
* I speak at conferences and meetups
* I give workshops - both in-person and virtually
* I am a mentor

I've created this site to make finding the content I produce and the events I am attending easier.

If you would like to collaborate with me, for me to speak at your event/meetup or you're a new developer/devrelian and you'd like some help/mentorship - then please complete this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScj9TuqRBOblAsp02B_r9uvNVSaUfKp5nX7hbV2RjYtqBjAkQ/viewform).
