Hello!
My name is Layla and I am a .NET developer! I also identify as a woman and that is less common combination in the wider .NET community.
In January 2021, I decided to host an entire year of female speakers at the meetup group I co-organise, .NET Milton Keynes.

I am often asked how to find women .NET speakers so I decided to create this site dedicated to all the wonderful .NET individuals that also identify as women!
