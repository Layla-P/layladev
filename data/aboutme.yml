  Hello! I'm Layla and I'm a developer with a love for C#! I have been awarded a Microsoft MVP for the past 4 years in developer technologies and a GitHub Star award the past 2 years. I love sharing knowledge whilst having fun and I definitely don't profess to know it all! No question is stupid and beginners are always welcome.
