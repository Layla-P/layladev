  - workshop-name: "The road to modularity - coming soon"
    workshop-description: "A complete guide to modularising your app into a maintainable, well-architected modular monolith."
  - workshop-name: "Building cloud-ready, resilient systems in .NET"
    workshop-description:  You may think that your application is already cloud-ready, it’s deployed in the cloud isn’t it?!
      But in truth, if your application is hard to monitor/scale/release/maintain, lacks resiliency, and is poorly structured, then it’s not “cloud-ready”.

      So what does “cloud-ready” actually mean?

      A “cloud ready” application is a legacy software application that has been modified to run on cloud computing infrastructure.

      Whether you are looking at a modular monolith or a full-blown distributed system, building a cloud-ready, resilient application is a must.

      In this workshop, we will look at the requirements for Tacky Tacos. A fictional taco business that’s thriving and wishes to expand.
      We’ll look at all the different requirements that need to be met, starting with a code kata and how we can apply various design patterns to our way of thinking.
      We’ll then move on to actually building out a functioning, all-be-it, contrived application in .NET 7 and C#, learning as we go.

      ## Topics we’ll cover:
      Architecture and Methodology
      Modular monolith vs microservices vs SOA
      Distribution and Modularization
      Common design patterns
      Modelling requirements

      ## Implementations
      .NET 7 application development recap
      Databases
      Synchronous communication
      Asynchronous communication
      API gateways and BFF
      Service discovery
      Resiliency

      ## Who is this workshop aimed at

      This workshop is aimed at backend developers with some experience writing web applications using C# and .NET.
      The workshop will not cover .NET Framework.

      ## Equipment and software
      - A computer – either Windows PC or macOS (I have no experience with Linux so if you bring a Linux machine my problem-solving will be limited)
      - Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider
      - VS Code
      - .NET 7
      - Docker Desktop
      - Postman or similar
