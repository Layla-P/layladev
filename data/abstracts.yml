    content: "Layla is a Developer Advocate at VMware serving the .NET community. She is a Live Coder on Twitch, a Microsoft MVP, a GitHub Star, and the founder of the #WomenOfDotNet Initiative. Layla loves sharing knowledge whilst having fun. No question is stupid and beginners are always welcome."
  - title: "APIs Exposed!"
    content: "More and more developers are building APIs, whether that be for consumption by client-side applications, exposing endpoints directly to customers so they can use an alternative front-end or wrapping up services in containers."
  - title: "Building cloud-ready applications in .NET"
    content: "Applications are growing increasingly complex, and harder to manage and monitor. Throw in globally distributed microservices and distributed teams; things only get more challenging. Yet there are tools and libraries out there that can empower you the developer to make considered decisions that make everyone's lives easier, from architects to SREs. Libraries such as Steeltoe (based on the ever-popular Spring Boot for Java), YARP and Polly are just a few and in this session, I will show you how, with just a few lines of code, you can greatly improve the cloud-readiness of your application."
  - title: "Understanding Microservices: a guide for the monolithic developer - REVISED!"
    content: "Microservice Architecture and the reasons why you should move to it, and the reasons you shouldn’t, have been well discussed. If you have already decided to move over to microservices from monolithic development, then you may be finding the whole process a bit daunting."
  - title: "Azure Functions - a guide to getting started"
    content: "Working with an existing system and its architecture can be a challenge, especially when it comes to adopting newer technologies. What may originally have been an appropriate architecture, may not now easily accommodate these newer technologies"
  - title: "TDD and the Terminator - An introduction to Test Driven Development"
    content: "Getting started with Test Driven Development (TDD) can be very challenging. It requires a different mindset and approach to writing and developing code. However, once in that mindset, it is very difficult not to write tests first."
  - title: "Bridging The Gap - a keynote co-presented with Alyssa Nicoll"
    content: "Introvert and extrovert, frontend and backend, this language or that one, with children or without. There are so many gaps in our industry that can have consequences if not bridged - will you get the promotion? Will you get the new job? Will your voice be heard? There are many ways to bridge a gap, and often the best way isn’t obvious. Layla and Alyssa hope, that through their stories and experiences, they can bring mindfulness and compassion to the forefront of your thoughts and help you bridge the gaps in your career and life."
