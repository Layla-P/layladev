  - title: "Learning in public - Live coding on Twitch"
    content: "Twitch has been traditionally a place for people to watch people play video games. However, there has been a recent rise in live coders on Twitch sharing knowledge and breaking down barriers. I am a proud member of the Twitch coding community and a member of The Live Coders Team. We learn in public which requires vulnerability and patience. It was challenging at first, showing my flaws in front of 10s of viewers, yet the community is surprisingly supportive and involved. We often end up mob-programming and all learning together. In this session, I will tell you why you should check out the growing community of developers on Twitch and hopefully inspire you to start your own journey to learn in public!"
